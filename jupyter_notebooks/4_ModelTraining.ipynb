    "* Filter to recent data (2020-2025) for better model performance\n",
    "* Train regression model (BR1) to predict price movement\n",
    "* Train classification model (BR2) to predict trade profitability\n",
    "* Evaluate both models with appropriate metrics\n",
    "* Save both models for dashboard deployment\n",
